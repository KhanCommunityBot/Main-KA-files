# Khan Community Bot

This team will be creating a bot for Khan Academy, which will monitor posts before they are submitted to the public. 
For example, if a user asks a question related to Energy Points, the bot will recognize certain keywords like "energy points"... 
The bot will then offer a link to the article(s) (on Khan Academy or their Help Center) which will hopefully answer their 
question before they post it.
